    "# Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: The dataset used for predictive modeling was generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model, which is an open-source, spatially-explicit computer simulation program that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangement, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency and yield of the wild blueberry agroecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Through the provided features predict the wild blueberry yield amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Description**:\n",
    "- Clonesize: m2 The average blueberry clone size in the field\n",
    "- Honeybee: bees/m2/min Honeybee density in the field\n",
    "- Bumbles: bees/m2/min Bumblebee density in the field\n",
    "- Andrena: bees/m2/min Andrena bee density in the field\n",
    "- Osmia: bees/m2/min Osmia bee density in the field\n",
    "- MaxOfUpperTRange: ℃ The highest record of the upper band daily air temperature during the bloom season\n",
    "- MinOfUpperTRange: ℃ The lowest record of the upper band daily air temperature\n",
    "- AverageOfUpperTRange: ℃ The average of the upper band daily air temperature\n",
    "- MaxOfLowerTRange: ℃ The highest record of the lower band daily air temperature\n",
    "- MinOfLowerTRange: ℃ The lowest record of the lower band daily air temperature\n",
    "- AverageOfLowerTRange: ℃ The average of the lower band daily air temperature\n",
    "- RainingDays: Day The total number of days during the bloom season, each of which has precipitation larger than zero\n",
    "- AverageRainingDays: Day The average of raining days of the entire bloom season"
