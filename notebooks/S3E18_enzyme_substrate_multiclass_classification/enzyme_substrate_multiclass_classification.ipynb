    "# Enzyme Substrate Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** Enzymes are known to act on molecules with structural similarities with their substrates. This behaviour is called promiscuity. Scientists working in drug discovery use this behaviour to target/design drugs to either block or promote biological actions. But, correct prediction of EC class(s) of substrates associated with enzymes has been a challenge in biology. Since there is no shortage of data, ML techniques can be employed to solve the aforementioned problem.\n",

    "**Feature Description**:\n",
    "- Geometry[-]: geometry of the heat source\n",
    "- Pressure [Mpa]: Pressure inside the boiler\n",
    "- Length [mm]: the heated length of the heat source\n",
    "- Dh [mm]: channel heated diameter\n",
    "- De [mm]: channel equivalent (or hydraulic) diameter\n",
    "- chf_exp: Experimental critical heat flux [MW/m2]\n",
    "- mass_flux [kg/m2 s]: In physics and engineering, mass flux is the rate of mass flow\n",
