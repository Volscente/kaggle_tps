    "# Crab Age Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** For a commercial crab farmer knowing the right age of the crab helps them decide if and when to harvest the crabs. Beyond a certain age, there is negligible growth in crab's physical characteristics and hence, it is important to time the harvesting to reduce cost and increase profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** The dataset is used to estimate the age of the crab based on the physical attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Description:**\n",
    "- Sex - Gender of the Crab (Male, Female and Indeterminate)\n",
    "- Length - Length of the Crab (Feet)\n",
    "- Diameter - Diameter of the Crab (Feet)\n",
    "- Height - Height of the Crab (Feet)\n",
    "- Weight - Weight of the Crab (Ounces)\n",
    "- Shucked Weight - Weight without the shell (Ounces)\n",
    "- Viscera Weight - It is weight that wraps around your abdominal organs deep inside body (Ounces)\n",
    "- Shell Weight - Weight of the Shell (Ounces)\n",
    "- Age - Age of the Crab (Months)\n",
